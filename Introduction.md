### FEATURES OF C++
- C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C Language to include an Object Oriented-Paradigm.  It is an imperative and compiled language.
  ### C++ has a number of features, including:
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Simple and popular
  - High-Level Language
  - Strongly typed
  - Case-sensitive
  - Memory Management (Dynamic Memory Allocation)
  - Multi-threading support

### INTRODUCTION
- C++ is derived from C Language. It is a Superset of C. 
- Earlier C++ was known as C with classes. 
- In C++, the major change was the addition of classes and a mechanism for inheriting class  objects into other classes. 
- Most C Programs can be compiled in C++ compiler. 
- C++ expressions are the same as C expressions. 
- All C operators are valid in C++. 

### STRUCTURE OF CPP PROGRAM
- ***Comments(documentation)***
- ***Preprocessor Statements/ Header File  Inclusion***
- ***Function Declaration***
- ***Global Variable Declaration***
- ***Extern Variable Declaration***
- ***Structure / Class Declaration***
- ***Function definitions***
### HELLO WORLD IN CPP
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int a;
cin>>a; //cin is object of istream
cout<<"Hello world !""<<endl; //cout is  object of ostream
return 0;
}
```
- Compilation: on Linux Platform 
                - g++  Hello.cpp 
- After compilation it will produce a.out file
                - Execution: ./a.out

### 
 

 ``` >> ``` called as extraction or input operator
 ``` << ``` is called as insertion operator or output operator
 ``` using namespace std ``` is used to specify namespace
 ``` return 0 ``` tell OS that program execution is graceful
